# Invoice Generator
## Description
A little PHP project to generate invoices using HTML.

Originally, this was a local browser-based interface, where you'd run the server and generate the invoices using a form.
Now it's a CLI, because it's much easier to edit invoices this way!

## Instructions

With php8, run `php generate.php INVOICE_NAME.json`
