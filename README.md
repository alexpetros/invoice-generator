# Invoice Generator
*Still unfinished.*

## Description
A little PHP project to generate invoices using HTML. It stores the generated invoices in a SQLite database so that you can view past invoices, and quickly make new ones.

Right now it has a browser interface, and I will add a CLI interface that parses JSON invoice configs as well.

## Instructions
* `make` - Start the local server
* `make reset-db` - Delete local database and make a new one from scratch
